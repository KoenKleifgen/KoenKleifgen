# Koen Kleifgen's `README`

I'm fairly new to coding. I kind of got thrown into it out of nowhere, and it's difficult for me. That doesn't mean I don't think that it's cool, and I want to learn more about it. I started when I joined a class that showed me the basics, but we do some decently difficult projects, and I find myself stressing over them. I want to enjoy coding, as I find it very cool, and I like that you can do or make anything you want with it, granted you know how to use it properly. I also like bunnies... there cute! üêá

## Languages
Because I am still fairly new to coding, I haven't explored many different languages, and I am not even close to mastering or fully understanding any. The ones I have started to use are:
- Python
- Html
- Css
  
I'd say the one I know the best is Python, but I also like CSS a lot. I find it fun to see everything come together, adjusting the little details; it just seems fun.

## Progects
Being new to coding, when I work on projects in class, I always work with my friend if allowed, as he is much better at everything that me. We have done some self projects for fun.
